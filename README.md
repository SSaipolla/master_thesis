Emotion analysis has different approaches, starting with detection of heartbeat and changes in hormones as advanced, ending with simple facial expression recognition. But one approach, emotion detection through voice, is still new due to the novelty of artificial neural networks. So, I decided to test this approach and create a system, which will convert voice of the person into spectrogram and train with it convolutional neural network. I will try to implement image classification, especially voice spectrogram, into different types of emotion by using last available tools in sphere Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
